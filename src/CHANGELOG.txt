    - [Initialization Error] - Fixed the initialization error on first-login.

====== Version 2.5.0 ======

    - [Combat Logging] - auto enable combat logging when entering a raid instance.
    - [Herb / Mining Switcher] - will swap between Track Herbs & Track Mining every few seconds.
    - [DKP Cleanup] - now deletes entries that are older than 15 days from the history. Should cut back on merge times.

[Bug Fixes]:
    [Raid tools]
        - Usable by anyone, not just officers or assistants.
        - Resets spam message if it's empty and the window is closed.
    [Lockout Timers]
        - Now are formatted better with colons in between the timestamps.
    [Syncing]
        - Sync allowances is now handled by addon interface settings. This will prevent syncs from occurring in the middle of raids.
    [Shrouding Window]
        - I believe I fixed the shrouding window sizing issue. TBD though as it's hard to reproduce.
    [DKP Officer Visual Bug]
        - The DKP Officer's window was not accurately updating the DKP when bosses were killed, and so Item-wins were being visually mis-calculated.
        This didn't affect actual DKP numbers.

====== Version 2.2.4 ======
[New Features]:
    - [Raid Officer Interface]
        - Auto invite feature (defaults to: "inv" and "invite") for raids. This can be customized, if you're an officer.
        - Added a button to auto give "assist" to all officers in the raid.
        - Added auto-guild reminder (once every 90 seconds) about raid invites being out. Stops after 15 mins
            or after you click the stop button.
    - [DKP Officer Raid Promotion]
        - Raid leaders & assist can now "assign" someone to be the DKP Officer in their raid.
        - Shrouding data will come from this person's addon (make sure they're up to date!)
        - Boss kills will result in a pop-up on the DKP Officer's screen, for quick-boss-kill dkp distribution.
    - [AQ & Naxx Tables]
        - Added & Disabled for the time-being.
    - [PDKP Map Icon]
        - Notifies you when your DKP tables are out of date (or tries to).
        - Left-click to open PDKP
        - Left-Shift-Click to request an officer push (15 min cool-down between sync requests). This will sync all
            members that are online with the broadcast data received from the officers.
        - Officer manual push capabilities moved here.

    - Removed Elementium Ore from announcements list.

[Changes]:
    - Changed how the addon communicates with other members of the guild via the comm channels.

[Disabled]:
    AQ40 & Naxx Tables


====== Version 1.1.0 ======

[Bug fixes]:
    - Shrouding popup now works properly
    - "You are not in a guild" error message now handled properly for alts not in guild.
    - Live updates now work again, sorry about breaking them before.
    - Push merges and overwrites are considerably faster (originally was around 10 minutes, now around 1.5)
    - History fixed for updates
    - DKP re-sync'd between the different raids (check yours to make sure it's correct).
    - Raid loot announcements should now properly link the item prio only if it is defined in our database.

[Disabled]:
    - Auto-sync when logging in. This appears to create an error on the officer's side of things. When a member logs in
        and out in quick succession, it tries to send a bulk message (a few messages that are queued) to the now offline
        member causing an error message ("Player xyz is not online") to fill up their chat box.

====== Version 0.9.0 ======

General Usage:
    [PDKP UI Scaling]
        - Scaling should hopefully be fixed for everyone now. TBD, as I never have encountered and scaling issues.
    [Deselect All Classes]
        - Added ability to deselect all classes via the "All Classes" button.
    [History]
        - History is now loaded on demand, rather than all at once. It will load the 10 most recent items, with
        additional 10 being able to be loaded at a time. This should fix the lag issues when opening the history
        frame. Unfortunately, the scroll position is not saved between sessions, so it defaults back to the top.
        Nothing I can do about that, unfortuantely.
    [Loot Announcements]
        - When the MasterLooter opens a lootable entity, they will now automatically link all items in the entity
        along with the prio for each item (if defined). If the item is not defined, it will return "Undefined".
    [Loot Prio Lookup]
        - Members will now be able to access our Loot Prio in game, by using these two methods:
            - /prio Item_Link - example: /prio [Staff of the Shadow Flame]
            - /prio Item_Name - example: /prio Boots of the Shadow Flame
        - These commands are case, plural & singular sensitive, so the link option is probably best for consistent results.

Admin Usage:
    [Other Text Box]
        - Should now properly update the submit button enable / disable property.
    [DKP Adjustment Dropdown]
        - The dropdown should now properly auto-populate the raid selection, based on the sheet you're working in.
        - It will also Auto-calculate & update the dkp amount text box, if applicable.
    [Boss Kill Popup]
        - Upon detecting a boss kill, the addon will now present a popup for the ML to award 10 dkp to all members who
        are in the raid & are currently online.
        - Upon detecting the final boss kill, it will additionally add in the "Completion Bonus" for the raid, with the
        popup.

Addon-Code:
    [Data Sync]
        - Streamlined the member data propagation, so there should be less mistakes with data being sync'd (hopefully).
    [Cut down on database size]
        - Removed unnecessary & duplicated data.
    [Data Migration]
        - Added in migration from old data structure to the new one. Shouldn't have any negative affect going forward
        though a /reload might be necessary after initially uploading if an error occurs.

Work In Progress:
    [Shroud Popup Box Update]
        - Currently working to get the shroud box to auto-close when an item that is defined in the loot-prio list is
        handed out to a member in the raid.
    [New: Roll Box]
        - Similar concept to the shroud box, but this would capture the rolls that are going out, and order them by the
        highest roller.
