====== Version 0.9.0 ======

General Usage:
    [PDKP UI Scaling]
        - Scaling should hopefully be fixed for everyone now. TBD, as I never have encountered and scaling issues.
    [Deselect All Classes]
        - Added ability to deselect all classes via the "All Classes" button.
    [History]
        - History is now loaded on demand, rather than all at once. It will load the 10 most recent items, with
        additional 10 being able to be loaded at a time. This should fix the lag issues when opening the history
        frame. Unfortunately, the scroll position is not saved between sessions, so it defaults back to the top.
        Nothing I can do about that, unfortuantely.
    [Loot Announcements]
        - When the MasterLooter opens a lootable entity, they will now automatically link all items in the entity
        along with the prio for each item (if defined). If the item is not defined, it will return "Undefined".
    [Loot Prio Lookup]
        - Members will now be able to access our Loot Prio in game, by using these two methods:
            - /prio Item_Link - example: /prio [Staff of the Shadow Flame]
            - /prio Item_Name - example: /prio Boots of the Shadow Flame
        - These commands are case, plural & singular sensitive, so the link option is probably best for consistent results.

Admin Usage:
    [Other Text Box]
        - Should now properly update the submit button enable / disable property.
    [DKP Adjustment Dropdown]
        - The dropdown should now properly auto-populate the raid selection, based on the sheet you're working in.
        - It will also Auto-calculate & update the dkp amount text box, if applicable.
    [Boss Kill Popup]
        - Upon detecting a boss kill, the addon will now present a popup for the ML to award 10 dkp to all members who
        are in the raid & are currently online.
        - Upon detecting the final boss kill, it will additionally add in the "Completion Bonus" for the raid, with the
        popup.

Addon-Code:
    [Data Sync]
        - Streamlined the member data propagation, so there should be less mistakes with data being sync'd (hopefully).
    [Cut down on database size]
        - Removed unnecessary & duplicated data.
    [Data Migration]
        - Added in migration from old data structure to the new one. Shouldn't have any negative affect going forward
        though a /reload might be necessary after initially uploading if an error occurs.
